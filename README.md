# Expo Go Incompatibility Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Expo Go with a third-party library that has native dependencies or requirements not met by the Expo Go environment.

## Problem

Attempting to run an Expo app using a library with native modules or system-specific requirements within Expo Go results in an error. The exact error message varies, but it generally indicates a failure to load or initialize the library due to the limitations of the Expo Go runtime.

## Solution

The solution involves either finding an alternative library that is compatible with Expo Go or using EAS Build (or a similar solution) to build a native app for testing and deployment. Expo Go is primarily intended for rapid prototyping and testing of apps without native dependencies.
